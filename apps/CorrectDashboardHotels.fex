-* Locate the hotel databases based on the rollup codes in your excel file, and then if the CHAIN_CODE in 
-* HR_50 matches the CHAIN_CODE field in your excel file for that rollup code, and if the field CHKIN_DATE 
-* in HR_50 falls within Effective Date and End Date in your excel file, I should update CLIENT_PREF in 
-* HR_50 to have value of "P" if it was blank.  If it was not blank, the value in CLIENT_PREF should not be changed.
